# World-Cup-Application

<p align="left">
  This is an android app that allows the user to search for, add, edit, and delete teams participarting in the world cup. This application also makes use of RoomDB to store world cup data and can view team points, wins, losses and more. Teams you can add include Argentina, Brazil, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, England, Netherlands, Morocco and Croatia. This app makes use of flag images representing each country. So that the list wouldn't be too long I have limited the countries to these ones listed here.
